################
Aldryn Redirects
################

This is a modified version of Django's ``django.contrib.redirects`` app that
supports language-dependent target URLs, using ``django-parler``.

This is useful for cases in which another middleware strips the language
prefix from the URL, like django CMS. It allows to define different urls to
redirect to, depending on the user's language.
